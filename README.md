# MVDs
Draft Model View Definitions for the IFC4 data model by Reinhard Wimmer.

To open the MVD files, you will need to use the IFC Documentaion Generater, provided by buildingSMART International:

Or you check the generated HTML Documentation. Just open the Documentation\eneffbim\html\content.htm file and explore the MVD.
