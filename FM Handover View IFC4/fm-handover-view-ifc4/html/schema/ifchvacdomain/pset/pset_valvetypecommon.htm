Reference ID for this specified type in this project (e.g. type 'A-1'), Also referred to as "construction type". It should be provided as an alternative to the name of the "object type", if the software does not support object types.

Status of the element, predominately used in renovation or retrofitting projects. The status can be assigned to as "New" - element designed as new addition, "Existing" - element exists and remains, "Demolish" - element existed but is to be demolished,  "Temporary" - element will exists only temporary (like a temporary support structure).

The configuration of the ports of a valve according to either the linear route taken by a fluid flowing through the valve or by the number of ports where:

SINGLEPORT: Valve that has a single entry port from the system that it serves, the exit port being to the surrounding environment.
ANGLED_2_PORT: Valve in which the direction of flow is changed through 90 degrees.
STRAIGHT_2_PORT: Valve in which the flow is straight through.
STRAIGHT_3_PORT: Valve with three separate ports.
CROSSOVER_4_PORT: Valve with 4 separate ports.

 <a href="../../ifchvacdomain/pset/penum_valveoperation.htm">PEnum_ValveOperation</a></td><td>
The method of valve operation where:

DROPWEIGHT: A valve that is closed by the action of a weighted lever being released, the weight normally being prevented from dropping by being held by a wire, the closure normally being made by the action of heat on a fusible link in the wire
FLOAT: A valve that is opened and closed by the action of a float that rises and falls with water level. The float may be a ball attached to a lever or other mechanism
HYDRAULIC: A valve that is opened and closed by hydraulic actuation
LEVER: A valve that is opened and closed by the action of a lever rotating the gate within the valve.
LOCKSHIELD: A valve that requires the use of a special lockshield key for opening and closing, the operating mechanism being protected by a shroud during normal operation.
MOTORIZED: A valve that is opened and closed by the action of an electric motor on an actuator
PNEUMATIC: A valve that is opened and closed by pneumatic actuation
SOLENOID: A valve that is normally held open by a magnetic field in a coil acting on the gate but that is closed immediately if the electrical current generating the magnetic field is removed. 
SPRING: A valve that is normally held in position by the pressure of a spring on a plate but that may be caused to open if the pressure of the fluid is sufficient to overcome the spring pressure. 
THERMOSTATIC: A valve in which the ports are opened or closed to maintain a required predetermined temperature.
WHEEL: A valve that is opened and closed by the action of a wheel moving the gate within the valve.

 <a href="../../ifchvacdomain/pset/penum_valvemechanism.htm">PEnum_ValveMechanism</a></td><td>
The mechanism by which the valve function is achieved where:

BALL: Valve that has a ported ball that can be turned relative to the body seat ports.
BUTTERFLY: Valve in which a streamlined disc pivots about a diametric axis.
CONFIGUREDGATE: Screwdown valve in which the closing gate is shaped in a configured manner to have a more precise control of pressure and flow change across the valve.
GLAND: Valve with a tapered seating, in which a rotatable plug is retained by means of a gland and gland packing.
GLOBE: Screwdown valve that has a spherical body.
LUBRICATEDPLUG: Plug valve in which a lubricant is injected under pressure between the plug face and the body.
NEEDLE: Valve for regulating the flow in or from a pipe, in which a slender cone moves along the axis of flow to close against a fixed conical seat.
PARALLELSLIDE: Screwdown valve that has a machined plate that slides in formed grooves to form a seal.
PLUG: Valve that has a ported plug that can be turned relative to the body seat ports.
WEDGEGATE: Screwdown valve that has a wedge shaped plate fitting into tapered guides to form a seal.
