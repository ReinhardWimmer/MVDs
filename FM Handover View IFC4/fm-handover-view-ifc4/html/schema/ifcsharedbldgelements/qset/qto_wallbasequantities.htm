<tr><th>Name</th><th>Type</th><th>Description</th>
<tr><td>Length</td><td>
<span class="self-ref">Q_LENGTH</span>
</td><td>
Total nominal length of the wall along the wall center line (even if different to the wall path).
</td></tr>
<tr><td>Width</td><td>
<span class="self-ref">Q_LENGTH</span>
</td><td>
Total nominal width (or thickness) of the wall measured perpendicular to the wall path. It should only be provided, if it is constant along the wall path.
</td></tr>
<tr><td>Height</td><td>
<span class="self-ref">Q_LENGTH</span>
</td><td>
Total nominal height of the wall. It should only be provided, if it is constant along the wall path. 
</td></tr>
<tr><td>GrossFootprintArea</td><td>
<span class="self-ref">Q_AREA</span>
</td><td>
Area of the wall as viewed by a ground floor view, not taking any wall modifications (like recesses) into account. It is also referred to as the foot print of the wall.
</td></tr>
<tr><td>NetFootprintArea</td><td>

</td><td>
Volume of the wall, without taking into account the openings and the connection geometry.
</td></tr>
<tr><td>NetVolume</td><td>
<span class="self-ref">Q_VOLUME</span>
</td><td>
Volume of the wall, after subtracting the openings and after considering the connection geometry.
