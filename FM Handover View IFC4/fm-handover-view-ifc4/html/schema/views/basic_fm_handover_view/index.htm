<h1> Update of the IFC2x3 based FM Handover View to IFC4 Add2. </h1>
<p> First Draft </p>
<hr>
<h2> General Information </h2>
<p> New defined Concepts and Properties, according to FM Handover View. </p> <br>
<p> Concepts can be found under <span class="self-ref">Operation Concepts</span> </p> <br>
<p> Property Sets have the Prefix <i>POpe</i> for <q>Properties for Operation</q>. </p> 
<hr>
<h3> Questions and Comments </h3>
<p> FMHOV uses Coordination View as a reference view. This could be handled by RV or DTV for IFC 4 if necessary. Needs to be checked! </p> <br>
<p> How shall we handle the entity <i>Furniture, Fixture and Equipment</i> ? It is defined as <i>Any other furniture, fixture and equipment</i> </p> <br>
<p> Space Boundaries are defined seperately for Door and Window. This should be covered by the 1st level Space Boundary concept, assigned to IfcSpace. Needs to be checked! </p> <br>
<p> Properties for IfcSpace require a Space Cladding. This Property is not defined and is covered by other Properties, like wall covering, ... </p> <br>
<p> <i> Building Service Element MEP </i> is represented by <i> IfcDistributionFlowElement </i> as an abstract entity of all HVAC components </p> <br>
<p> Project Representation Context is not exactly what the FMHOV demands. Needs to be checked. </p> <br>
<p> ERM export requirements do not comply with the concepts, parts of concepts are set to be mandatory for the export, while some parts are not. Decision: If the some parts of concepts are meant to be mandatory for the export, the export of the concept will be set to mandatory. </p> <br><p>By Reinhard Wimmer</p>
